# What is pre-authorization?


Pre\-authorization is an activity performed by the bank when making a contactless payment on a payment machine or reader. This is a temporary blocking of funds on the client's account \- depending on the bank, the blocked amount may range from PLN 1 to PLN 50\. Importantly, funds from the customer's account are temporarily unavailable, but they always return to the account. In some cases, removing the blockage may take several days due to different processing times and the FALA system has no influence on this.
