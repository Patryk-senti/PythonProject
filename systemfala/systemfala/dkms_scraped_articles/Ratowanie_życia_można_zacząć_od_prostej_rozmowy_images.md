There are around 70 individuals, most of whom are wearing bright red t-shirts with text on them. They appear to be part of a gathering, possibly a conference or a study group. Many participants are also wearing name tags, suggesting they are from a structured event.

The group is arranged in two layers. In the front, some individuals are sitting on the ground, while others stand behind them. There’s a mix of genders and various hairstyles, with some people having long hair, while others are sporting shorter styles. 

In the background, you can see the hotel entrance, which has large glass doors and windows. The building's facade is modern and minimalistic, with a light-colored exterior. Above the door, the name "ARCHE HOTEL GEOLOGICZNA" is prominently displayed in gold lettering.

The atmosphere appears cheerful and friendly, indicative of a group enjoying their time together at this location. The ground is made of laid stones, and there are some plants and decorations visible around the entrance. Overall, the image captures a sense of community and engagement among the participants.
