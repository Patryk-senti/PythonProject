- **Description**: The image features a digital temperature display mounted on a wall. It shows a reading of 25.0°C, indicating the current room temperature. Just above this main reading, the set temperature is displayed as 24.0°C. The device bears the label "HMI Compact" and the brand "EL-PIAST" prominently noted at the bottom.

The display has a dark background with bright blue text, and it includes icons representing various functions, possibly related to cooling or heating. Below the display screen, there are several buttons, likely for adjusting settings or navigating through options.

In the background, part of a door frame is visible, suggesting this is a room within a larger facility, possibly a hospital or clinic, indicated by a blue sign and a fixed bench to the right. The walls are light in color, contributing to a clean and clinical atmosphere. A computer monitor can be seen in the lower part of the image, although the focus remains on the temperature control device.
