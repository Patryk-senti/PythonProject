- **Description**: The image appears to be a promotional banner or display related to a campaign urging people to become stem cell donors. The text is written primarily in Polish, with "Zostań dawcą szpiku !!!" prominently featured at the top, translates to "Become a stem cell donor !!!" 

Below this main message, the image credits several individuals: 

- "zdjęcia" (photos) attributed to Lena Darska and Filip Rychlik
- "narrator" attributed to Eliza Krych
- "montaż" (editing) attributed to Leonia Szczepanowska-Lay

At the bottom of the image, there is a note stating that registration is available at the website www.dkms.pl, indicating that this might be part of a larger initiative by DKMS, an organization focused on bone marrow registration and donation.

The background features a red banner with the DKMS logo, and the scene likely includes volunteers or participants in a fundraising or awareness event with decorations such as balloons, contributing to a positive and communal atmosphere.
