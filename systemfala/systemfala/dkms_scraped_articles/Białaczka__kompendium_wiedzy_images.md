- **Description**: The image illustrates two test tubes filled with a red liquid, representing blood. On the left side, the label "ZDROWA KREW" translates to "Healthy Blood," and it is accompanied by a circular inset showing a close-up of the blood composition. This zoomed-in view depicts numerous red blood cells (erythrocytes), which are round and disc-shaped, and a smaller number of white blood cells (leukocytes), which are generally larger and have a more irregular shape.

On the right side, the label "BIAŁACZKA" translates to "Leukemia," accompanied by another circular inset. This view similarly shows red blood cells, but there is a notable increase in the number of white blood cells, which may reflect an abnormal distribution typical of leukemia.

The overall color palette is bright, with the red of the blood being prominent, and the labels are written in bold blue letters. The illustration emphasizes the difference between healthy blood and blood affected by leukemia through visual comparison.

Below this magnified image, a gloved hand holds a test tube containing a sample, possibly blood or bone marrow, and the tube is designed with red liquid inside, along with an orange cap.

In the bottom center of the image, there is text in blue that reads "BIOPSJA ASPIRACYJNA SZPiku Z MOSTKA," which translates to "Aspiration biopsy of bone marrow from the sternum" in English, indicating the procedure being depicted.
