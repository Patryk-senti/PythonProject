- **Description**: The image features two circular illustrations representing blood samples, positioned side by side. On the left, labeled "zdrowa krew" (which translates to "healthy blood"), the illustration predominantly displays numerous red circular shapes, symbolizing red blood cells, with a few smaller purple cells that likely represent white blood cells. This side appears vibrant and filled with these cells, conveying a sense of healthy blood.

On the right, labeled "chora krew" (meaning "sick blood"), the illustration contains a mix of red cells similar to the left, but there are fewer of them and more purple cells, suggesting a higher presence of abnormal or infected cells. This side looks less dense and more scattered, indicating health issues.

In the background, there is a faint representation of a microscope, hinting at a scientific context for examining blood samples. The overall color scheme is light and soft, creating a clear distinction between the two types of blood.

- **Description**: The image contains a visually engaging layout featuring various text bubbles arranged around a central concept. The main focus is on the phrase "Objawy wynikają z niedoboru prawidłowych, dojrzałych komórek krwi," which translates to "Symptoms resulting from a deficiency of normal, mature blood cells." This central text is emphasized in larger font within a purple bubble.

Surrounding this central phrase, there are several smaller text bubbles containing symptoms related to this deficiency, written in a combination of purple and light blue fonts. The symptoms listed include:

- **Zabieg tolerancji wysiłku** (decreased exercise tolerance)
- **Ostąpienie** (weakness)
- **Łatwe siniaczenie się** (easy bruising)
- **Bladość skóry** (paleness of the skin)
- **Zmęczenie** (fatigue)
- **Krwawienia** (bleeding)
- **Wybroczyny** (purpura)
- **Objawy niedoborów odporności** (symptoms of immune deficiency)
- **Dusznosć** (shortness of breath)

Additionally, there are illustrations of red blood cells and other abstract shapes, contributing to the overall educational and visual appeal of the image. The colors are primarily soft pastels with hints of red, creating a calm yet informative atmosphere.

- **Description**: The image features a stylized representation related to medical testing. On the left side, there is a blood collection tube, prominently labeled "BADANIE KRWI," which translates to "blood test" in Polish. It has a red stripe and a blue cap, positioned upright.

To the right, there's a graphical representation of a bone marrow biopsy needle, labeled "TREPANOBIOPSJA SZPIKU," meaning "bone marrow biopsy" in Polish. This element is illustrated in blue and depicts the needle with a cylindrical structure.

In the background, there is a microscope graphic, along with DNA helix icons, adding to the scientific theme. The overall design is minimalistic and uses bright colors against a white background, emphasizing the medical context of the image.

- **Description**: The image features a bright and modern illustration related to medical and healthcare themes. Central to the composition is a blood bag filled with red liquid, symbolizing blood donation or transfusion. The bag is designed with a light blue exterior and is connected to a tube at its base.

Surrounding the blood bag are several other medical items: 

1. **A Syringe** - This is depicted with a white barrel and a blue plunger, positioned to the right of the blood bag, suggesting its use for drawing blood or administering injections.

2. **A Blister Pack of Pills** - Located to the left of the blood bag, this pack contains several round tablets, characterized by teal dots. It conveys the idea of medication.

3. **A Pill** - A single pill is shown above the blister pack, with a glossy appearance that suggests it's ready for use.

Additionally, light abstract shapes, like circles and molecular structures, are scattered in the background, enhancing the medical theme and providing a dynamic visual appeal. The overall color palette is clean, primarily using red, blue, and teal, set against a white background.
